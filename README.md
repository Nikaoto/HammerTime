A local multiplayer game made in Lua with LOVE in 48 hours for the New Age GameJam in Tbilisi.


## Download
Go into the release folder and download the executable file for your os. If you have LOVE installed you can
download the HammerTime.love file and launch that. Either way works.

## Play
**The game requires at least two gamepads to play**

You lose stamina while your weapon seathed. Swing your hammer as fast as you can and hit other players,
The faster you swing, the more damage you deal (and the more you knock others back). Dodging is a
great way to escape. While dodging, you go through obstacles and other weapons. Be careful though, dashing
costs a lot of stamina and you might fall off the pillar if you don't watch your step.

## Controls
Recommended players 2 and up (to infinity, as long as you can plug that many joysticks)
Joysticks are a MUST!

* Move - Left Analog
* Rotate - Right Analog
* Sheath Hammer - Right Bumper
* Swing Hammer - Right Analog (literally, swing the analog around)
* Dash - Left Bumper

## TODO list for maybe the future
* Scaling for bigger screens
* Better pillar + fix collisions for bigger displays
* Falling animations
* Clouds during fighting

### TODO list for the GameJam (old)
* Runes - kind of like powerups, but with more magic and less arcade-y-ness
* ~~Physics - calculate angular velocity depending on analog swing speed and apply it linearly to hit players~~ **EZPZ**
* ~~Pillar - players stand on a huge pillar. They can knock each other off it~~ **Done!**
* Hole - a hole in the middle of the pillar. Anyone who trips, R.I.P.s
* ~~Blood Particle Effects - now with 20% more gore and violence~~ **Donezo!**
* ~~Deathmatch - the main game mode~~ **Yeppeperoni!**
* Announcer - the kind of announcer from moba games
* ~~Sounds~~ - **yes. Lots of 'em**

## Final Notes
Kind of ironic, a game of violence and murder made with LOVE. heh.
