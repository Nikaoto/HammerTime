# HammerTime
A local multiplayer game made in Lua with LOVE. Joysticks are a MUST!
Recommended players 2 and up (to infinity, as long as you can plug that many joysticks)

## Controls
* Move - Left Analog
* Rotate - Right Analog
* Sheath Hammer - Right Bumper
* Swing Hammer - Right Analog (literally, swing the analog around)
* Dash - Left Bumper

## How to play?
You lose stamina while your weapon seathed. Swing your hammer as fast as you can and hit other players,
The faster you swing, the more damage you deal (and the more you knock others back). Dodging is a 
great way to escape. While dodging, you go through obstacles and other weapons. Be careful though, dashing
costs a lot of stamina and you might fall off the pillar if you don't watch your step.

## TODO list
* Runes - kind of like powerups, but with more magic and less arcade-y-ness Impossibru ;C
* ~~Pillar - players stand on a huge pillar. They can knock each other off it~~ Done!
* Hole - a hole in the middle of the pillar. Anyone who trips R.I.P.s
* ~~Blood Particle Effects - now with 20% more gore and violence~~ Donezo!
* ~~Deathmatch - the main game mode~~ Yeppeperoni!
* Announcer - the guy from moba games who says PENTAKIRRU - Nah :/
* ~~Sounds~~ - yes. Lots of 'em

## Final Notes
Kind of ironic, a game of violence and murder made with LOVE. heh.
