#HammerTime
A local multiplayer game made in Lua with LÖVE. Joysticks are a MUST!
Recommended players 2 and up (to infinity, as long as you can plug that many joysticks)

##Controls
*Move - Left Analog
*Rotate - Right Analog
*Sheath Hammer - Right Trigger
*Swing Hammer - Right Analog (literally, swing the analog around)

##How to play?
You lose stamina while your weapon seathed. Swing your hammer as fast as you can and hit other players,
The faster you swing, the more damage you deal (and the more you knock others back).

##TODO list
*Runes - kind of like powerups, but with more magic and less arcade-y-ness
*Pillar - players stand on a huge pillar. They can knock each other off it
*Hole - a hole in the middle of the pillar. Anyone who trips R.I.P.s
*Blood Particle Effects - now with 20% more gore and violence
*Deathmatch - the main game mode
*Announcer - the guy from moba games who says PENTAKIRRU
*Sounds - yes.

##Final Notes
Kind of ironic, a game of violence and murder made with LÖVE. heh.
